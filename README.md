## Example

Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, exploring, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. I can hear a song by Miley Cyrus drifting through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. I bite my lip, and one of his hands moves into my hair, holding me firmly in place as we kiss. 

'Face the wall,' he murmurs, shallowing my breath and coursing heat throughout my body. 

He smiles a slow sexy smile. If only it didn't take a contract and a leather strap to please him. That leather strap! We've never used a leather strap before. I can't imagine how he wants to use *that*. 

'God, I need you,' he growls as he hovers over me. Moving suddenly, he grabs me by the shoulders, shoving me against the doorway. I groan loudly, panting, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He gently skims his fingertips up my thighs. All the air leaves my body. How does he have this power over me?
